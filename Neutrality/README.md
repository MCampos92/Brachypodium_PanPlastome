# Neutrality Tests

In this section, you can find the scripts and input data to detect positive selection  using the genes of the plastomes.

> This repository contains data and instructions to run scripts used in different analyses of *Brachypodium* plastoems data included in the paper:
>
> "The *Brachypodium* panplastome reveals extended heteroplasmy and positive selection in the chloroplast genomes of its three annual model grasses" by Miguel Campos Cáceres.
>
> And co-authored by Ernesto Pérez-Collazos, John Vogel and Pilar Catalán. 

## Neutrality test
To detect the positive selection and make the graphs we employed:
- `Neutrality.R` the main script in R to do all the analysis and plots.
- A folder with the individual alignments of each gene per species/group
