> This repository contains data and instructions to run scripts used in different analyses of *Brachypodium* plastoems data included in the paper:
>
> "The *Brachypodium* panplastome reveals extended heteroplasmy and positive selection in the chloroplast genomes of its three annual model grasses" by Miguel Campos Cáceres.
>
> And co-authored by Ernesto Pérez-Collazos, John Vogel and Pilar Catalán. 

## Table of Contents
### DAPC
In this section you can find the input and the script used to generate a DAPC analysis used in the plastomic data (Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components).

### Indels and Heteroplasmy
In this section you can find the input and the script used to detect insertions/deletions in the alignment and parse it with the heteroplasmic positions.

### Neutrality test
In this section you can find the Rscript used to detect positive selection  using the genes of the plastomes.
