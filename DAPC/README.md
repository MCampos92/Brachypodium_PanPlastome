# Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC)

In this section, you can find the scripts and input data for the DAPC done in R using Adegenet package.

> This repository contains data and instructions to run scripts used in different analyses of *Brachypodium* plastoems data included in the paper:
>
> "The *Brachypodium* panplastome reveals extended heteroplasmy and positive selection in the chloroplast genomes of its three annual model grasses" by Miguel Campos Cáceres.
>
> And co-authored by Ernesto Pérez-Collazos, John Vogel and Pilar Catalán. 

## Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC)
For the DAPC test performed, we need 3 files: 
- `PlastotypeD.fasta` that contains the plastome sequences analyzed.
- `PlastotypeS.fasta` that contains the plastome sequences analyzed.
- `DAPC.R` is the main script with all the commands used in R.
